## Usage Instructions
Navigate to a dashboard inside of Smartsheet, then click the extension icon in the top right. The grid will be visible in the background of the dashboard whenever you are in the editing view (accessible with the "Pencil icon" in the top right) of the dashboard.

To change the grid layout that is added/displayed, right-click on the extension icon and select "Options". This will take you to a settings screen where you can select a different layout or add a custom one.

### Known Bugs
- If you resize the window after adding the grid, the grid itself will not resize. You can fix this by double-clicking on the Chrome extension icon to remove/re-add the grid.

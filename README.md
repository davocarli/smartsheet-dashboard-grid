# Smartsheet Dashboard Grid Helper
A Chrome extension that overlays a grid over the Smartsheet Dashboard editor. This can help with spacing out your widgets consistently.

## Usage Instructions
Navigate to a dashboard inside of Smartsheet, then click the Pencil icon in the top right to enter the editing view for the dashboard. Once in the editing view, click the extension icon to add the grid to the background of the dashboard.

## Planned Updates
- Fix both of the bugs noted in the "Known Bugs" section.
- Add multiple grid layouts to select from.
- Add the ability to create your own grid layouts.
- Add grid layouts that are not purely columns, but can also include items placed on the vertical plane. 

### Known Bugs
- If you resize the window after adding the grid, the grid itself will not resize. You can fix this by double-clicking on the Chrome extension icon to remove/re-add the grid.
- If you click the chrome extension icon while the dashboard is not in editing mode, the grid will technically be added but will be invisible. When you then begin editing the dashborad, you will need to double-click the extension icon to remove & re-add the grid.
